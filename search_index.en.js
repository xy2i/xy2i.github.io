annotations in the Linux kernel to determine atomic\ncontext violations, or writing Postgres functions in Rust.\nWell, what if I told you rustc, the Rust compiler, is a library, and you can\ndo that without forking the compiler?\nIn this post, we'll go compare them\nto their C/C++ version, why you would use or not use them and how they work\nat a high level.\nFrom compiler plugin to compiler driver\nBoth Clang and GCC have their own version of what they call \"compiler\nplugins\". These let you write code that extend the compiler, and are nice\nbecause you don't have to change compiler code.\nRust's approach is a bit different.\nRust provides the entire compiler API to developers. Everything is public, so\nyou can use all the compiler crates freely, as a library. Your\nprogram becomes a wrapper over the Rust compiler.\nOne use for this are tools that you can run over a Rust codebase:\n\nClippy (and the lesser known Dylint) wrap the compiler to add lints.\nMiri runs against Rust's control graph and detects undefined behavior.\ncargo-doc-coverage gives the amount of documented items in a crate.\n\nA more niche use is for Rust compiler authors to prototype quickly against the\nRust codebase without having to maintain a separate branch or fork: for example,\nPolonius implements a next generation borrow checker, the part of Rust that\nchecks lifetimes.\nFinally, these can be also used as custom compilers for a specific project,\nreplacing rustc and adding extra analysis or behavior. For example, klint in\nRust for Linux tracks preemption count at compile time, by reading the CFG,\nand erroring otherwise (check out their full blog post!):\nerror: this call expects the preemption count to be 0\n  --&gt; samples/rust/rust_sync.rs:76:17\n   |\n76 |  kernel::delay::coarse_sleep(core::time::Duration::from_secs(1));\n   |  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   |\n   = note: but the possible preemption count at this point is 1\n\nBenefits and drawbacks\nThe main drawback is that nothing is stable. Apart from the\nrustc-driver and associated APIs, any internal APIs you depend on may break\nbetween compiler updates.\nOf course, maintaining a compiler driver also has significant complexity, not\nonly for implementers but\nespecially if you want to keep it up to date.\nIf you don't have esoteric needs or you don't fit one or the above use cases,\nsee if proc macros can solve them.\nCool, how do I make one?\nBecause drivers are forever unstable, any code I give here is likely to be\noutdated in a year's time. Instead I'll stick to high level recommendations.\nTo learn how the whole system works, check out the Peeking at\ncompiler-internal data talk (slides here).\nFor reference, check out the rustc dev guide, the official Rust\ncompiler doc. In particuliar the sections on rustc-driver and\nqueries are of great interest.\nFor reference implementations, the highest quality one is probably\nplrustc. Of note is their build script which outputs a statically linked\nrustc without dependencies. Make sure to use RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP in your\n.cargo/config so your driver can depend on stable versions.\nSummary\nRust's compiler-as-a-library approach offers you the ability to extend the Rust\ncompiler with custom lints, compiler errors, and even create custom standard\nlibraries and semantics.\nWhile there are benefits to this approach, like making special-purpose tools and\ncustom compilers, it also comes with drawbacks, most notably the lack of\nstability and the need for ongoing maintenance to keep up with new Rust\nversions.\nBut if you have specific needs, it opens up new possibilities for extending and customizing Rust.\n","id":"https://xy2.dev/blog/hacking-rustc/","title":"Rust compiler-as-a-library"},"https://xy2.dev/blog/simple-proc-macro/":{"body":"\nSummary: An explaination of how to implement practical procedural macros in\nthe Rust programming language. Explains the\ndifferent types of macros, then shows an\nimplementation of a procedural macro following best practices, focusing\non testing and ergonomics.\nAssumes some familiarity with Rust.\n\nIn Rust, a macro is code that writes other code, enabling\nmetaprogramming.\nRust uses macros to add features on top of the core language, like\nthe println!() macro, providing variadic arguments and string\ninterpolation. They can also be used for code generation,\nremoving the need for error-prone copy-and-paste programming. Macros are even\npowerful enough to create domain-specific languages, or type-checked\nSQL at compile-time.\nWhen should you use or not use procedural macros?\nTo be clear - most of the time, you don't need procedural macros.\n\nIf you want to use a declarative macro in #[my_macro] or #[derive(MyMacro)\nposition, then use the macro_rules_attribute library.\nIf you need more complicated logic in your declarative macros, take a look at\nThe Little Book of Rust Macros if you can use their techniques.\n\nDeclarative macros, the classic form of macros, rely on purely declarative\nlogic. They look something like this:\nmacro_rules! expr {\n    (eval $a:expr + $b: expr) =&gt; {\n        println!(\"{}\", $a + $b);\n    }\n}\n\nexpr!(eval 1 + 2);\n// evaluates to\nprintln!(\"{}\", 1 + 2);\n\nThey use their own separate, declarative language. But declarative macros are\nnot without warts and are pretty hard to understand if they get bigger and\nbigger.\nRust introducted procedural macros in Rust\n1.30 for custom #[attributes]. Unlike declarative macros,\nproc macros use Rust directly, so you're writing the macros in the same\nlanguage, which makes it much easier to scale. For this reason, you should\nconsider proc macros if you need to deal with a large macro.\nBut procedural macros have drawbacks. First, to do anything practical, you'll\nlikely need the syn library, notorious for long build times. And second,\nthere are still many footguns left in proc macros today. This guide will\nexplain the ones I know of.\nNote that once you do invest into procedural macros, it's easier to write\nthe next ones, because a fair bit of the cost is up-front.\nOverall, consider procedural macros if one of these applies:\n\nYou need to develop a large, complex macro and are hitting declarative macro\nlimitations.\nYour declarative macro has grown too large and hard to understand, and you\nneed to extend it further.\nYou need complex procedural logic in your macro.\n\nA short primer\nThere are three different\ntypes of\nprocedural macros:\n\nfunction like: my_macro!(...)\nderive macros: #[derive(MyMacro)]\nattribute macros: #[my_macro(arguments)]\n\nThese types differ only by their syntax when invoked. Function-like, as their\nname suggests, act like your usual declarative macros.\nDerive macros can apply in any #[derive(..)] block. This makes them most\ninteresting for macros that need to generate code on structs.\nAttributes macros are a more general version, which can be applied to any\n\"item\" in Rust: structs, traits, functions, types and so on. The\ntokio::main macro is a\ngood example of why to use this kind of macro: it decorates a main function,\nwithout having to add an extra level of indentation. Compare with the function\nlike syntax:\ntokio_main! { // extra indentation\n    fn main() {\n        println!(\"hello world\")\n    }\n}\n\nThe most important difference is procedural macros operate on tokens, not the\nAST directly, so the proc macro has to reimplement parsing of Rust source code.\nThis is most often done with syn.\nProcedural macros are compiler extensions: they are currently run as part of\nthe compiler. This is the main reason why they have to be declared in a\nseparate\ncrate.\nFinally, proc macros are not fully hygienic (it's\ncomplicated). Most\nimportantly, like declarative macros, they are not path hygenic, so you need to\nuse full paths, eg. std::thread::spawn, or include use statements if you\ncan.\nUse cargo-expand to manually test\nand see the output of a macro.\nCreating a proc macro\nAs we have to declare the proc macro in a separate crate, and assuming we have\nsome code already, we'll need at least two crates: one for your proc macros and\nanother one for the rest of your code.\nI recommend using a workspace to organise this. Workspaces are an\nintegrated way within Cargo to have multiple crates. If you use other systems\nto build your macro code, take a look at the proc macro Rust rules for gn\nor Bazel.\nHere's an example with two crates, your library crate and the proc macro crate.\nYou'll need to create the workspace layout yourself as there is no tool to do\nso automatically yet.\nmy_project/             // new folder\n├─ my_crate/\n│  ├─ Cargo.toml\n│  ├─ lib.rs\n├─ my_crate_proc_macro/ // macro crate (cargo new --lib my_crate_proc_macro)\n│  ├─ Cargo.toml\n│  ├─ lib.rs\n├─ Cargo.toml           // new file\n\nNow to declare the proc macro:\n# my_crate_proc_macro/Cargo.toml\n[lib]\nproc-macro = true\n\nAdd your newly declared proc macro crate as a dependency to your main crate's\nCargo.toml, so it can use it:\n# my_crate/Cargo.toml\n[dependencies]\nmy_crate_proc_macro = { path = \"../my_crate_proc_macro\" }\n\nThen add the workspace at the top level, above the two crates:\n# Cargo.toml\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\n    \"my_crate\",\n    \"my_crate_proc_macro\",\n]\n\nHere's an example of an function-like proc-macro. Add the #[proc_macro]\nattribute to a function in your proc macro crate to make it a proc macro.\nEach kind of proc macro has a different signature, but they all take and return\nTokenStream,\na list of tokens.\n#[proc_macro]\npub fn my_macro(item: proc_macro::TokenStream) -&gt; proc_macro::TokenStream {\n    item\n}\n\nFoundational crates for best practices proc macros\nIt's possible to use proc macros without any dependencies, but using these\nwill save you trouble and headaches over the long run.\nTesting: proc_macro2\nThis crate is a wrapper around the proc_macro crate from the compiler, which\nyou use to create a proc macro. However, proc_macro is not usable in\nnon proc-macro contexts, meaning you can't use it in tests.\nproc_macro2 is a wrapper around the compiler crate. This means, most\nimportantly for us, that you can use the proc macro in tests.\nMany other crates in the ecosystems have separate functions for proc_macro\nand proc_macro2, for example syn::parse vs syn::parse2.\nHere's an example of how proc_macro2 can be useful. In this example,\nwe separate the parts with\nproc_macro and proc_macro2, and test the proc_macro2 parts. The actual\nproc macro does a roundtrip from proc_macro2 structures and back. (Do not use\nthe test in this example, see below.)\n#[proc_macro]\npub fn my_macro(item: proc_macro::TokenStream) -&gt; proc_macro::TokenStream {\n    my_macro_impl(item.into()).into()\n}\n\nfn my_macro_impl(_item: proc_macro2::TokenStream) -&gt; proc_macro2::TokenStream {\n    \"fn macro_generated() -&gt; u32 {\n        42\n     }\"\n    .parse()\n    .unwrap()\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn unit() {\n        // test for illustrative purposes\n        // do not use this test, see `quote` section below\n        assert_eq!(\n            my_macro_impl(\"\".parse().unwrap()).to_string(),\n            \"fn macro_generated() -&gt; u32 { 42 }\"\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nCreating trees: quote\nIn our test, we converted the TokenStreams to strings, because they don't\nimplement Eq, so we can't compare them directly.\nCan you spot the error in the test?\nassert_eq!(\n    my_macro_impl(\"\".parse().unwrap()).to_string(),\n    \"fn macro_generated() -&gt; u32 { 42 }\"\n);\n\nThe proper result is actually \"fn macro_generated () -&gt; u32 { 42 }\", with a\nspace between macro_generated and the ().\nTo test this macro, we used the string conversion of TokenStream, which just\noutputs each distinct token with a space between, stripping newlines.\nTo avoid this, convert to and from a TokenStream:\nassert_eq!(\n    my_macro_impl(\"\".parse().unwrap()).to_string(),\n    \"fn macro_generated() -&gt; u32 { 42 }\".parse::&lt;proc_macro2::TokenStream&gt;()\n        .unwrap().to_string()\n);\n\nAs you can see, this way is pretty error prone. At this point you'd likely make\na helper.\nThe confusion stems from our using strings as a way to\nrepresent Rust source code, because we must create the TokenStream by some\nmethod. Here, we confused a string with code written raw, but not\nconverted, with one converted from a TokenStream.\nThere's a more convenient way: the third-party quote crate, turning any code\npassed into a token tree directly. quote has a few niceties, including\ninterpolation and repetition.\nHere's the previous example rewritten to use quote:\nuse quote::quote;\n\n#[proc_macro]\npub fn my_macro(item: proc_macro::TokenStream) -&gt; proc_macro::TokenStream {\n    my_macro_impl(item.into()).into()\n}\n\nfn my_macro_impl(_item: proc_macro2::TokenStream) -&gt; proc_macro2::TokenStream {\n    quote! {\n        fn macro_generated() -&gt; u32 {\n            42\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn unit() {\n        assert_eq!(\n            my_macro_impl(quote!(\"\")).to_string(),\n            quote! {\n                fn macro_generated() -&gt; u32 {\n                    42\n                }\n            }\n            .to_string()\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nWe'll see more of the power of quote as we go. Overall, it's more\na convenience than anything, though be careful when testing if you choose not\nto use it.\nParsing Rust: syn\nWhat if our macro takes some Rust input, and we want to parse it? There are two\nchoices.\nFirst, we can manually parse the subset of Rust we want. This is doable but\nespecially tedious. If you choose to go this route, the best way to go is\nprobably looking at macros not using syn, doc-comment's source\ncode\ncould be a good starting point. You save out on the long compile times of\nsyn.\nHowever, this is painful, and brittle in the face of new syntax, so you'll\nprobably want to use syn if you're doing anything pretty complex.\nWe've talked a lot about tokens so far, but not so much about syntax\ntrees\n. Put\nsimply, abstract syntax trees are much easier to deal with than tokens, as they\ndon't need to represent details in the real syntax, like the parentheses and\nbrackets, as well as the actual symbols you type out in source code.\nHere's the abstract syntax tree for a simple pub fn main() {}:\nItem::Fn {\n    attrs: [],\n    vis: Visibility::Public(\n        Pub,\n    ),\n    sig: Signature {\n        constness: None,\n        asyncness: None,\n        unsafety: None,\n        abi: None,\n        fn_token: Fn,\n        ident: Ident {\n            sym: main,\n            span: bytes(8..12),\n        },\n        generics: Generics {\n            lt_token: None,\n            params: [],\n            gt_token: None,\n            where_clause: None,\n        },\n        paren_token: Paren,\n        inputs: [],\n        variadic: None,\n        output: ReturnType::Default,\n    },\n    block: Block {\n        brace_token: Brace,\n        stmts: [],\n    },\n}\n\nOf course, syn can parse any Rust syntax, not just functions.\nI recommend using the AST Explorer and putting Rust\ncode in. This is an easy way to see what data is available on an syn AST.\nHere's an example that reverses the name of the function.\nFor this example, we're using an attribute macro. It takes an extra\nargument (the arguments in #[my_macro(arguments)]).\nuse quote::quote;\n\n#[proc_macro_attribute]\npub fn my_macro(\n    _attr: proc_macro::TokenStream,\n    item: proc_macro::TokenStream,\n) -&gt; proc_macro::TokenStream {\n    my_macro_impl(_attr.into(), item.into()).into()\n}\n\nfn my_macro_impl(\n    _attr: proc_macro2::TokenStream,\n    item: proc_macro2::TokenStream,\n) -&gt; proc_macro2::TokenStream {\n    let mut func: syn::ItemFn = match syn::parse2(item.clone()) {\n        Ok(it) =&gt; it,\n        Err(e) =&gt; return e.into_compile_error(),\n    };\n\n    let ident = func.sig.ident;\n    let reversed: String = ident.to_string().chars().rev().collect();\n    func.sig.ident = syn::Ident::new(&amp;reversed, ident.span());\n\n    quote! { #func }\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn unit() {\n        assert_eq!(\n            my_macro_impl(\n                quote!(\"\"),\n                quote! {\n                    fn my_function(a: u32) {}\n                }\n            )\n            .to_string(),\n            quote! {\n                fn noitcnuf_ym(a: u32) {}\n            }\n            .to_string()\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nWe use syn::parse2 to parse\ninto the type on the left, here an ItemFn\nwhich is a function.\nAs an aside,\nbecause the macro may be applied to something else than a function, eg. in\nfront on a struct, we might not be able to parse a function. In this case we\nbail and return the error.\nThe naive way to do this would be to panic, but this gives subpar error\nmessages (proc macro panicked). So it would be nice at least to reuse syn's\nerror.\nBut we can't return an error in proc macros - only tokens. The\nmain way around this is to return tokens containing core::compile_error\nfrom the Rust standard library.\nWhen that compile error is evaluated, it will return a nice compiler error for\nthe user. There's a convenient\ninto_compile_error()\nin syn to do this.\nTesting compiler errors: trybuild\nWe've talked a bit about errors. It would be nice to solidfy this in our\ntests: let's test our errors.\nProblem: an error message isn't just a message, so testing macro expansions\nlike we did before is missing a bit of the picture. Here's what a parse error\nlooks like for our macro currently, when we try to apply it, for example, to a\nstruct:\nerror: expected `fn`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:3:1\n  |\n3 | struct A;\n  | ^^^^^^\n\nWe have the error message, generated by syn with into_compile_error:\nexpected `fn`. But that's not all. Under the error is the code it applies\nto highlighted.\nThis is why strings aren't enough for macros. On top of the code, Rust includes\na Span,\nthat describes where the token was in the original code. (Spans are also used\nfor macro hygiene\npurposes, mainly\nrelevant for identifiers.)\nOkay, so how do we test compiler errors? I recommend using\ntrybuild. Let's try it out with our\nerror output from above put in tests/struct.stderr:\n// tests/struct.rs\nuse my_crate_proc_macro::my_macro;\n#[my_macro]\nstruct A;\n\nmod tests { // ...\n    #[test]\n    fn compile_errors() {\n        let t = trybuild::TestCases::new();\n        t.compile_fail(\"tests/*.rs\");\n    }\n}\n\nFor each test that it finds, trybuild will compile it, check that it fails\nand compare the error output to the corresponding .stderr file. trybuild\ncan generate these .stderr files for you as well.\nSummary\nI hope this article has given you a good overview of procedural macros, as well\nas how to get started in a practical manner.\nProc macros are (too?) complicated, and the lack of a fully integrated guide\nhurts their usability. The documention is there, just scattered around,\nand it's hard to get started.\nIf you're looking for good\npractice, the best resource is likely the Proc Macro\nWorkshop made by David Tolnay,\nthe author of many of the libraries listed here.\n","id":"https://xy2.dev/blog/simple-proc-macro/","title":"Practical Procedural Macros"}},"docInfo":{"https://xy2.dev/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://xy2.dev/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://xy2.dev/blog/hacking-rustc/":{"body":357,"title":3},"https://xy2.dev/blog/simple-proc-macro/":{"body":1311,"title":3}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
